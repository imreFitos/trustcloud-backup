# TrustCloud-Backup

TrustCloud is an online service for documenting evidence for various compliance audits like SOC2.

There is currently no way to download all the data one has painstakingly built in the platform.

This script downloads all the important work TrustCloud exposes via their API. 
As they grow, I'm sure the API will have more features available. 

More details about their API at https://community.trustcloud.ai/docs/trustcloud-api/guides/

## Installation

This is a script written in Python, it uses only the commonly available python libraries so you should be able to run it as it is.

## Usage

./backup.y [name of directory to download data to - should not exist yet]

## Contributing

Since I'm leaving TrustCloud, this will be abandonware from the beginning - I encourage you to fork it. 
Since I'm losing my access to TrustCloud, I won't even be able to help you with questions.
